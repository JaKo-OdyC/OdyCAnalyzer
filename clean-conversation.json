I can help you design a system with specialized agents for different types of analysis - requirements extraction, user perspective analysis, documentation gap identification, and meta-analysis.

      "content": "Perfect! For OdyC chat data analysis, I recommend these specialized agents:\n\n1. **Structure Agent**: Organizes conversations into logical document sections\n2. **Requirements Agent**: Extracts functional, non-functional, and technical requirements\n3. **User Perspective Agent**: Identifies user needs, personas, and feedback patterns\n4. **Documentation Agent**: Finds gaps and suggests missing documentation\n5. **Meta Agent**: Provides overall quality assessment and improvement suggestions\n\nWould you like multiple output formats like HTML, Word, and LaTeX?",

I'll implement comprehensive output format support:\n\n**HTML**: Modern responsive design with professional styling\n**Word (DOCX)**: Native Microsoft Word format with proper headings and formatting\n**LaTeX**: Complete academic document structure with bibliography support\n**Wiki**: MediaWiki-compatible markup for platforms like Notion or Confluence\n**Enhanced Markdown**: Improved structure with metadata and AI attribution\n**JSON**: Raw structured data for programmatic access\n\nEach format will maintain consistent content while optimizing for its specific use case. Should we start implementing the agent orchestration system?",
