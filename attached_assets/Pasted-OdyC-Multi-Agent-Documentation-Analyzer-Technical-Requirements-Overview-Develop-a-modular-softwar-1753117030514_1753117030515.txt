OdyC Multi-Agent Documentation Analyzer â€“ Technical Requirements
Overview

Develop a modular software tool that ingests large volumes of exported OdyC chat and project data, automatically analyzes, structures, and documents content by leveraging multiple AI agents (multi-model, multi-perspective), and outputs structured documentation for further use in development, research, and project management.
Core Features
1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing

    Import OdyC chat and project data in JSON, Markdown, TXT, or other supported formats (from official export or preprocessed sources).

    Parse and segment data by:

        Timestamp

        Topic

        User role (e.g., developer, teacher, researcher)

        Development stage (e.g., idea, draft, prototype, live)

        Container type (e.g., requirements, user needs, open questions, frontend, security)

2. Multi-Agent AI Analysis Pipeline

    Agent Orchestration Layer:

        Manage and schedule analysis tasks for multiple AI agents (e.g., via OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, or local models).

        Each agent can be configured to run on specific data segments or to focus on particular analysis types.

    Agent Types (at minimum):

        Structure Agent: Suggests document structure, sectioning, and metadata extraction.

        Requirements Agent: Extracts developer requirements, status, and implementation notes.

        User Perspective Agent: Identifies user needs, requests, and feedback.

        Documentation Agent: Systematically records open questions, missing links, and documentation gaps.

        Frontend Research Agent: Highlights ideas and research regarding user interfaces and representation.

        Security Agent: Extracts and prioritizes security-relevant topics and requirements.

        Meta/Reflexion Agent: Identifies redundancies, ambiguities, and suggests improvements in logic or organization.

    Extensible Agent Registry:

        Allow easy addition of new analysis agents with custom prompts or logic.

3. Analysis Iteration and Specialization

    Support for multiple analysis passes:

        By section, topic, or container type

        Using different agents or specialized prompt sets per iteration

    Ability to select, prioritize, or re-run agents as needed

    Log all agent responses, proposed structures, and summary outputs for auditing

4. Synthesis and Output Generation

    Orchestration/Consensus Layer:

        Aggregate agent outputs, resolve conflicts, filter redundancies, and merge into a unified documentation draft.

        Output options:

            Markdown/HTML/Word/LaTeX files

            Wiki-ready pages (e.g., for Notion, Obsidian, MediaWiki)

            JSON structures for programmatic reuse

    Customizable Templates:

        Allow project-specific output templates for requirement specs, user stories, technical docs, etc.

5. API Integration

    RESTful API endpoints to:

        Upload and process new datasets

        Run or re-run specific agents on-demand

        Retrieve synthesized documentation outputs

        Integrate with external documentation platforms (e.g., GitHub, Notion)

6. Collaboration and Versioning

    Integrate with GitHub for:

        Version control of requirements and outputs

        Collaborative review and feedback cycles (pull requests, issues)

        Automated CI/CD for documentation updates

7. Debugging and Review Tools

    Log and visualize agent suggestions, decisions, and disagreements.

    Allow human-in-the-loop review:

        Accept/reject/modify agent suggestions before final output.

    Maintain traceability:

        Link output sections back to source chat/project data and responsible agent(s).

8. Spin-off Mechanisms (Self-Improvement)

    Systematically detect recurring patterns, modules, or workflows that can be abstracted into new OdyC Atoms, Processes, Clusters, or Modules.

    Suggest or auto-integrate reusable artifacts into the OdyC system knowledge base.

Technical Stack Recommendations

    Backend: Python (FastAPI, Flask), Node.js, or similar

    AI Agent Layer: OpenAI API, Gemini API, DeepSeek, LangChain, Haystack, or custom agent pipeline

    Frontend: React, Vue, or minimal dashboard (optional for MVP)

    Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or local files for early prototyping

    CI/CD & Repo: GitHub (Actions, Pull Requests, Issues, Wikis)

    Documentation: Markdown, Notion, Obsidian, MediaWiki, or custom exporter

Extensibility & Future Directions

    Modular agent addition (plug-in system)

    Support for multi-modal data (audio, image, code snippets)

    Live collaboration and annotation

    Advanced visualization (graphical representation of document structure, agent contributions, and atomic system evolution)

    Integration of feedback loops for continuous system improvement
