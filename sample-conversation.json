Here's what I recommend:\n\n1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Support multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, TXT)\n2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Different agents for different analysis types\n3. **AI Integration**: Use multiple AI providers for robust analysis\n4. **Output Generation**: Multiple formats including HTML, Word, LaTeX\n\nWhat specific types of analysis are you most interested in?",

Here's how I'd structure those agents:\n\n**Requirements Agent**: Extract functional, non-functional, and technical requirements from conversations\n**User Perspective Agent**: Identify user personas, needs, feedback patterns, and pain points\n**Documentation Agent**: Find gaps, missing context, unclear specifications\n**Meta Agent**: Provide high-level insights about conversation quality and patterns\n\nFor OdyC data specifically, we should also add:\n**Structure Agent**: Suggest document organization and sectioning\n\nWould you like me to help you implement this system?",

I'll implement:\n\n**HTML**: Professional styled reports with modern CSS\n**Word (DOCX)**: Native Microsoft Word documents with proper formatting\n**LaTeX**: Academic-quality documents ready for publication\n**Wiki**: MediaWiki-compatible markup for documentation platforms\n**Enhanced Markdown**: Improved structure with AI attribution\n**JSON**: Raw data export for programmatic access\n\nEach format will include AI model attribution and professional styling.
