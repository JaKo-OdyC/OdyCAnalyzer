## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🔐 API Key Security
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Rotate API keys regularly** (every 90 days recommended)
- **Use least-privilege access** for API keys when possible

#### 🌐 Network Security
- **Use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Implement proper firewall rules** for database access
- **Use VPNs or private networks** for sensitive deployments
- **Monitor access logs** regularly for suspicious activity

#### 💾 Data Security
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- **Regular database backups** with encryption
- **Implement data retention policies** for uploaded files
- **Sanitize data** before processing or storage

#### 🔄 Update Security
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Monitor security advisories** for used packages
- **Apply security patches** promptly
- **Test updates** in staging before production

### For Developers

#### 🛡️ Input Validation
- **Validate all user inputs** with Zod schemas
- **Sanitize file uploads** to prevent malicious content
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection

#### 🔍 Code Security
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web application security
- **Use TypeScript** for compile-time type safety
- **Implement proper error handling** without information leakage
- **Regular security code reviews** for sensitive components

#### 🏗️ Infrastructure Security
- **Use secure container configurations** for deployment
- **Implement proper access controls** for databases
- **Monitor system logs** for security events
- **Use secrets management** for sensitive configuration

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Potential Security Areas

#### 🤖 AI Integration
- **API key exposure** in client-side code
- **Prompt injection** attacks in user inputs
- **Data leakage** through AI model responses
- **Rate limiting bypass** for AI API calls

#### 📁 File Processing
- **Malicious file uploads** (zip bombs, malware)
- **Path traversal** attacks in file handling
- **Memory exhaustion** from large files
- **Script injection** in processed content

#### 🌐 Web Application
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** in user content
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** in forms
- **SQL injection** in database queries
- **Authentication bypass** vulnerabilities

#### 📊 Data Processing
- **Information disclosure** in error messages
- **Data validation bypass** in API endpoints
- **Privilege escalation** in user roles
- **Session hijacking** vulnerabilities

## Security Testing

### Automated Security

We use the following tools for automated security testing:

- **npm audit**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time type safety checking
- **Drizzle ORM**: SQL injection prevention through typed queries
- **Zod validation**: Runtime input validation and sanitization

### Manual Security Testing

Regular security assessments include:

- **Penetration testing** of web application
- **Code review** for security vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure assessment** for deployment security
- **Third-party security audits** (planned for major releases)

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Identify potential security incident
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and severity
3. **Containment**: Limit exposure and prevent further damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and fix vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations safely
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve security measures

### Communication Plan

- **Internal Team**: Immediate notification via secure channels
- **Users**: Timely notification if user data is affected
- **Public**: Transparent communication about fixes and improvements
- **Authorities**: Report to relevant authorities if required
